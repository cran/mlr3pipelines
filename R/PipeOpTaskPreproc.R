#' @title PipeOpTaskPreproc
#'
#' @usage NULL
#' @format Abstract [`R6Class`] inheriting from [`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @description
#' Base class for handling most "preprocessing" operations. These
#' are operations that have exactly one [`Task`][mlr3::Task] input and one [`Task`][mlr3::Task] output,
#' and expect the column layout of these [`Task`][mlr3::Task]s during input and output
#' to be the same.
#'
#' Users must implement `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()`, which have a [`Task`][mlr3::Task]
#' input and should return that [`Task`][mlr3::Task]. The [`Task`][mlr3::Task] should, if possible, be
#' manipulated in-place, and should not be cloned.
#'
#' Alternatively, the `$train_dt()` and `$predict_dt()` functions can be implemented, which operate on
#' [`data.table`][data.table::data.table] objects instead. This should generally only be done if all
#' data is in some way altered (e.g. PCA changing all columns to principal components) and not if only
#' a few columns are added or removed (e.g. feature selection) because this should be done at the [`Task`][mlr3::Task]-level
#' with `$train_task()`. The `$select_cols()` function can be overloaded for `$train_dt()` and `$predict_dt()`
#' to operate only on subsets of the [`Task`][mlr3::Task]'s data, e.g. only on numerical columns.
#'
#' If the `can_subset_cols` argument of the constructor is `TRUE` (the default), then the hyperparameter `affect_columns`
#' is added, which can limit the columns of the [`Task`][mlr3::Task] that is modified by the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]
#' using a [`Selector`] function. Note this functionality is entirely independent of the `$select_cols()` functionality.
#'
#' [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] is useful for operations that behave differently during training and prediction. For operations
#' that perform essentially the same operation and only need to perform extra work to build a `$state` during training,
#' the [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`] class can be used instead.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpTaskPreproc$new(id, param_set = ParamSet$new(), param_vals = list(), can_subset_cols = TRUE, packages = character(0), task_type = "Task")
#' ```
#'
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object. See `$id` slot of [`PipeOp`].
#' * `param_set` :: [`ParamSet`][paradox::ParamSet]\cr
#'   Parameter space description. This should be created by the subclass and given to `super$initialize()`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings given in `param_set`. The
#'   subclass should have its own `param_vals` parameter and pass it on to `super$initialize()`. Default `list()`.
#' * `can_subset_cols` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Whether the `affect_columns` parameter should be added which lets the user limit the columns that are
#'   modified by the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]. This should generally be `FALSE` if the operation adds or removes
#'   rows from the [`Task`][mlr3::Task], and `TRUE` otherwise. Default is `TRUE`.
#' * packages :: `character`\cr
#'   Set of all required packages for the [`PipeOp`]'s `$train` and `$predict` methods. See `$packages` slot.
#'   Default is `character(0)`.
#' * `task_type` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   The class of [`Task`][mlr3::Task] that should be accepted as input and will be returned as output. This
#'   should generally be a `character(1)` identifying a type of [`Task`][mlr3::Task], e.g. `"Task"`, `"TaskClassif"` or
#'   `"TaskRegr"` (or another subclass introduced by other packages). Default is `"Task"`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] has one input channel named `"input"`, taking a [`Task`][mlr3::Task], or a subclass of
#' [`Task`][mlr3::Task] if the `task_type` construction argument is given as such; both during training and prediction.
#'
#' [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] has one output channel named `"output"`, producing a [`Task`][mlr3::Task], or a subclass;
#' the [`Task`][mlr3::Task] type is the same as for input; both during training and prediction.
#'
#' The output [`Task`][mlr3::Task] is the modified input [`Task`][mlr3::Task] according to the overloaded
#' `$train_task()`/`$predict_taks()` or `$train_dt()`/`$predict_dt()` functions.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list`; besides members added by inheriting classes, the members are:
#' * `affect_cols` :: `character`\cr
#'   Names of features being selected by the `affect_columns` parameter, if present; names of *all* present features otherwise.
#' * `intasklayout` :: [`data.table`]\cr
#'   Copy of the training [`Task`][mlr3::Task]'s `$feature_types` slot. This is used during prediction to ensure that
#'   the prediction [`Task`][mlr3::Task] has the same features, feature layout, and feature types as during training.
#' * `outtasklayout` :: [`data.table`]\cr
#'   Copy of the trained [`Task`][mlr3::Task]'s `$feature_types` slot. This is used during prediction to ensure that
#'   the [`Task`][mlr3::Task] resulting from the prediction operation has the same features, feature layout, and feature types as after training.
#' * `dt_columns` :: `character`\cr
#'   Names of features selected by the `$select_cols()` call during training. This is only present if the `$train_dt()` functionality is used,
#'   and not present if the `$train_task()` function is overloaded instead.
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' * `affect_columns` :: `function` | [`Selector`] | `NULL` \cr
#'   What columns the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] should operate on. This parameter is only present if the constructor is called with
#'   the `can_subset_cols` argument set to `TRUE` (the default).\cr
#'   The parameter must be a [`Selector`] function, which takes a [`Task`][mlr3::Task] as argument and returns a `character`
#'   of features to use.\cr
#'   See [`Selector`] for example functions. Defaults to `NULL`, which selects all features.
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] is an abstract class inheriting from [`PipeOp`]. It implements the `$train_internal()` and
#' `$predict_internal()` functions. These functions perform checks and go on to call `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()`.
#' A subclass of [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] may implement these functions, or implement `$train_dt()` and `$predict_dt()` instead.
#' This works by having the default implementations of `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()` call `$train_dt()` and `$predict_dt()`,
#' respectively.
#'
#' The `affect_columns` functionality works by unsetting columns by removing their "col_role" before
#' processing, and adding them afterwards by setting the col_role to `"feature"`.
#'
#' @section Fields:
#' Fields inherited from [`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @section Methods:
#' Methods inherited from [`PipeOp`], as well as:
#' * `train_task`\cr
#'   ([`Task`][mlr3::Task]) -> [`Task`][mlr3::Task]\cr
#'   Called by the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]'s implementation of `$train_internal()`. Takes a single [`Task`][mlr3::Task] as input
#'   and modifies it (ideally in-place without cloning) while storing information in the `$state` slot. Note that unlike
#'   `$train_internal()`, the argument is *not* a list but a singular [`Task`][mlr3::Task], and the return object is also *not* a list but
#'   a singular [`Task`][mlr3::Task]. Also, contrary to `$train_internal()`, the `$state` being generated must be a `list`, which
#'   the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] will add additional slots to (see Section *State*). Care should be taken to avoid name collisions between
#'   `$state` elements added by `$train_task()` and [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].\cr
#'   By default this function calls the `$train_dt()` function, but it can be overloaded to perform operations on the [`Task`][mlr3::Task]
#'   directly.
#' * `predict_task`\cr
#'   ([`Task`][mlr3::Task]) -> [`Task`][mlr3::Task]\cr
#'   Called by the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]'s implementation of `$predict_internal()`. Takes a single [`Task`][mlr3::Task] as input
#'   and modifies it (ideally in-place without cloning) while using information in the `$state` slot. Works analogously to
#'   `$train_task()`. If `$predict_task()` should only be overloaded if `$train_task()` is overloaded (i.e. `$train_dt()` is *not* used).
#' * `train_dt(dt, levels, target)` \cr
#'   ([`data.table`], named `list`, `any`) -> [`data.table`] | `data.frame` | `matrix` \cr
#'   Train [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] on `dt`, transform it and store a state in `$state`. A transformed object must be returned
#'   that can be converted to a `data.table` using [`as.data.table`]. `dt` does not need to be copied deliberately, it
#'   is possible and encouraged to change it in-place.\cr
#'   The `levels` argument is a named list of factor levels for factorial or character features. The `target` argument
#'   contains the `$truth()` information of the training [`Task`][mlr3::Task]; its type depends on the [`Task`][mlr3::Task]
#'   type being trained on.\cr
#'   This method can be overloaded when inheriting from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], together with `$predict_dt()` and optionally
#'   `$select_cols()`; alternatively, `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()` can be overloaded.
#' * `predict_dt(dt, levels)` \cr
#'   ([`data.table`], named `list`) -> [`data.table`] | `data.frame` | `matrix` \cr
#'   Predict on new data in `dt`, possibly using the stored `$state`. A transformed object must be returned
#'   that can be converted to a `data.table` using [`as.data.table`]. `dt` does not need to be copied deliberately, it
#'   is possible and encouraged to change it in-place.\cr
#'   The `levels` argument is a named list of factor levels for factorial or character features.\cr
#'   This method can be overloaded when inheriting `PipeOpTaskPreproc`, together with `$train_dt()` and optionally
#'   `$select_cols()`; alternatively, `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()` can be overloaded.
#' * `select_cols(task)` \cr
#'   ([`Task`][mlr3::Task]) -> `character` \cr
#'   Selects which columns the [`PipeOp`] operates on, if `$train_dt()` and `$predict_dt()` are overloaded. This function
#'   is not called if `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()` are overloaded. In contrast to
#'   the `affect_columns` parameter. `select_cols` is for the *inheriting class* to determine which columns
#'   the operator should function on, e.g. based on feature type, while `affect_columns` is a way for the *user*
#'   to limit the columns that a [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] should operate on.\cr
#'   This method can optionally be overloaded when inheriting [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], together with `$train_dt()` and
#'   `$predict_dt()`; alternatively, `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()` can be overloaded.\cr
#'   If this method is not overloaded, it defaults to selecting all columns.

#' @usage NULL
#' @format Abstract [`R6Class`] inheriting from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]/[`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @description
#' Base class for handling many "preprocessing" operations
#' that perform essentially the same operation during training and prediction.
#' Instead implementing a `$train_task()` and a `$predict_task()` operation, only
#' a `$get_state()` and a `$transform()` operation needs to be defined,
#' both of which take one argument: a [`Task`][mlr3::Task].
#'
#' Alternatively, analogously to the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] approach of offering `$train_dt()`/`$predict_dt()`,
#' the `$get_state_dt()` and `$transform_dt()` functions may be implemented.
#'
#' `$get_state` must not change its input value in-place and must return
#' something that will be written into `$state`
#' (which must not be NULL), `transform()` should modify its argument in-place;
#' it is called both during training and prediction.
#'
#' This inherits from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] and behaves essentially the same.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple$new(id, param_set = ParamSet$new(), param_vals = list(), can_subset_cols = TRUE, packages = character(0), task_type = "Task")
#' ```
#' (Construction is identical to [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].)
#'
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object. See `$id` slot of [`PipeOp`].
#' * `param_set` :: [`ParamSet`][paradox::ParamSet]\cr
#'   Parameter space description. This should be created by the subclass and given to `super$initialize()`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings given in `param_set`. The
#'   subclass should have its own `param_vals` parameter and pass it on to `super$initialize()`. Default `list()`.
#' * `can_subset_cols` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Whether the `affect_columns` parameter should be added which lets the user limit the columns that are
#'   modified by the [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`]. This should generally be `FALSE` if the operation adds or removes
#'   rows from the [`Task`][mlr3::Task], and `TRUE` otherwise. Default is `TRUE`.
#' * packages :: `character`\cr
#'   Set of all required packages for the [`PipeOp`]'s `$train` and `$predict` methods. See `$packages` slot.
#'   Default is `character(0)`.
#' * `task_type` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   The class of [`Task`][mlr3::Task] that should be accepted as input and will be returned as output. This
#'   should generally be a `character(1)` identifying a type of [`Task`][mlr3::Task], e.g. `"Task"`, `"TaskClassif"` or
#'   `"TaskRegr"` (or another subclass introduced by other packages). Default is `"Task"`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' Input and output channels are inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].
#'
#' The output during training and prediction is the [`Task`][mlr3::Task], modified by `$transform()` or `$transform_dt()`.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`] is an abstract class inheriting from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] and implementing the
#' `$train_task()` and `$predict_task()` functions. A subclass of [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`] may implement the
#' functions `$get_state()` and `$transform()`, or alternatively the functions `$get_state_dt()` and `$transform_dt()`
#' (as well as `$select_cols()`, in the latter case). This works by having the default implementations of
#' `$get_state()` and `$transform()` call `$get_state_dt()` and `$transform_dt()`.
#'

#'   The state can then influence the `$transform()` function. Note that `$get_state()` must *return* the state, and
#'   should not store it in `$state`. It is not strictly necessary to implement either `$get_state()` or `$get_state_dt()`;
#'   if they are not implemented, the state will be stored as `list()`. \cr
#'   This method can optionally be overloaded when inheriting from [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`], together with `$transform()`;
#'   alternatively, `$get_state_dt()` (optional) and `$transform_dt()` (and possibly `$select_cols()`, from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`])

#' * `transform(task)` \cr
#'   ([`Task`][mlr3::Task]) -> [`Task`][mlr3::Task]\cr
#'   Predict on new data in `task`, possibly using the stored `$state`. `task` should not be cloned, instead it should be
#'   changed in-place. This method is called both during training and prediction phase, and should essentially behave the
#'   same independently of phase. (If this is incongruent with the functionality to be implemented, then it should inherit from
